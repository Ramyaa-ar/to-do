## How it Works ?
1. Adding Tasks:
The website provides an input field where users can enter a new task.
Upon entering a task, users can press a button or hit the "Add" button to add the task to the to-do list.
2. Displaying Tasks:
The to-do list dynamically updates to display the newly added task.
Each task is typically shown with a checkbox to mark it as completed and the task description.
3. Editing Tasks:
Users can select a task and initiate the editing mode, by clicking on the edit button.
The task text becomes editable, allowing users to modify the content.
After editing, users can save the changes, usually by pressing "Add" button.
4. Deleting Tasks:
Each task typically has a delete button or icon associated with it.
Clicking the delete button removes the task from the to-do list.
5. Marking Tasks as Completed:
Tasks have a checkbox that users can mark to indicate completion.
The appearance of completed tasks change to visually distinguish them from active tasks. The completed tasks would be striked off.
